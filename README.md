# programming-in-python-exercises
Sample programs and exercises from Mark Summerfield' book "Programming In Python 3".
Tarball with sources was downloaded from [book page on qtrac.eu](http://www.qtrac.eu/py3book31.tar.gz) and reorganized for greater convenience.
In original tar.gz archive all python files was simply packed in one directory, so I moved it into directories, by according chapters of the book.

There are 3 branches in repo:
 - master: where original py files lies, arranged by chapters dirs.
 - ans: where I put answers to exercises from book' author.
 - exercise: where I write my code for exercises.
